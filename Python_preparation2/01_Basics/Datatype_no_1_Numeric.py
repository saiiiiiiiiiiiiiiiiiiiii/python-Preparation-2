# Sure! In Python, numeric data types are used to represent numbers. 
# Python supports several numeric types, each with different properties and uses. 
# Hereâ€™s a detailed overview:

# 1. Integers (int)
# Description:Represents whole numbers,both positive and negative, including zero.
# Example
a = 42
print(a)
print(type(a))
b = -7
print(b)
print(type(b))

# 2. Floating-Point Numbers (float)
# Description: Represents real numbers with a fractional part. 
# They are implemented using double-precision (64-bit) in Python.
Floating_num = 3.14
print(Floating_num)
print(type(Floating_num))

# 3. Complex Numbers (complex)
# Description: Represents numbers with a real and an imaginary part. 
# The imaginary part is denoted with a j or J suffix.
# Format: a + bj, where a is the real part and b is the imaginary part.
Complex_num =  2 + 3j
print(Complex_num)
print(type(Complex_num))


# Numeric Type Conversion
# Python provides functions to convert between different numeric types:
# *) int(): Converts a number or a string to an integer.
x = int(3.14)  # x is 3
print(x)
print(type(x))

# float(): Converts a number or a string to a floating-point number.
y = float('3.14')  # y is 3.14
print(y)
print(type(y))

# complex(): Converts a number or a string to a complex number.
z = complex(2, 3)  # z is 2 + 3j
print(z)
print(type(z))

# Special Numeric Types
# Python also has some special numeric types and constants:
# Decimal: From the decimal module, provides decimal floating-point 
# Arithmetic with more precision and control than float.
from decimal import Decimal
d = Decimal('3.14')
print(d)

# Fraction: From the fractions module, 
# represents rational numbers as a pair of integers (numerator and denominator).
from fractions import Fraction
f = Fraction(3, 4)  # Represents 3/4
print(f)

# Arithmetic Operations
# Python supports a variety of arithmetic operations on these numeric types:

# Addition (+)
# Subtraction (-)
# Multiplication (*)
# Division (/)
# Floor Division (//)
# Modulus (%)
# Exponentiation (**)
a = 10
b = 3

sum_result = a + b        # 13
diff_result = a - b       # 7
prod_result = a * b       # 30
div_result = a / b        # 3.333...
floor_div_result = a // b # 3
mod_result = a % b        # 1
exp_result = a ** b       # 1000




# Summary
# int: Whole numbers, arbitrary precision.
# float: Real numbers, double-precision.
# complex: Numbers with real and imaginary parts.

# Understanding these numeric types and their operations 
# is fundamental to performing calculations and data manipulation in Python.
